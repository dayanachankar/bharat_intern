Welcome to the Bharat_Intern repository, where you'll find three machine learning projects focusing on different aspects of predictive modeling. Each project is implemented using linear regression and logistic regression and includes Google Colab notebook code for easy understanding and reproduction.

1. House Price Prediction:
In this project, we've developed a machine learning model to predict house prices with precision. By utilizing linear regression techniques, the model analyzes various features of houses and learns patterns to estimate their prices accurately. The Google Colab notebook code provides detailed explanations and step-by-step instructions on how to train and evaluate the model.

2. Wine Quality Prediction:
Our Wine Quality Prediction project aims to evaluate wine quality based on specific attributes, using linear regression. By training the machine learning model on a diverse dataset encompassing various wine characteristics, our model can predict the quality rating of any given wine sample. The Google Colab notebook code offers insights into data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation stages, making it accessible and informative.

3. Iris Flowers Classification:
This project delves into the classification of different iris flower species using logistic regression. By considering petal and sepal length, our machine learning model accurately identifies iris species. The Google Colab notebook code provides comprehensive explanations of data preprocessing, model training, and the classification process, making it an educational resource for those interested in similar classification tasks.

All three projects serve as practical demonstrations of regression's application in specific domains, showcasing its effectiveness for prediction tasks. By exploring the provided Google Colab notebook code, users can gain a deeper understanding of implementation details and potentially apply similar techniques to their own projec
